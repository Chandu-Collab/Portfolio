# 🔧 Fix EmailJS Template - Get ACTUAL Contact Form Submissions

## 🚨 Current Issue:
You're receiving auto-reply messages like "Thank You for Reaching Out!" instead of the actual contact form data from users.

## ✅ Solution: Create a CONTACT SUBMISSION Template

### Step 1: Go to EmailJS Dashboard
1. Visit **https://dashboard.emailjs.com/**
2. Go to **Email Templates**
3. Click on your template: **template_swq2jv6**

**In the "Settings" tab:**
- **To Email**: `{{to_email}}` (will be chandrahasareddy65@gmail.com)
- **To Name**: `{{to_name}}` (will be Chandra Hasa Reddy)
- **From Email**: `{{from_email}}` (user's email)
- **From Name**: `{{from_name}}` (user's name)
- **Reply To**: `{{reply_to}}` (user's email)
- **Subject**: `🚀 New Contact from {{contact_name}} - {{contact_subject}}`

### Step 3: CORRECT Template Content

**Replace your current template with this CONTACT FORM SUBMISSION template:**

```
